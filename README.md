# MusicalNoteClassification
Classify musical notes into five types of notes (whole, half, quarter, eighth, and sixteenth notes).

 - Created classification models using four algorithms: logistic regression, histogram gradient boosting trees, fully-connected neural networks, and convolutional neural networks
 - Applied each of these four algorithms to both 28 x 28 images and 64 x 64 images 
 - Used both grid search and randomized search to perform cross validation for the first three algorithms, while we manually tuned parameters for convolutional neural networks
 - Analyze how the runtime was affected by the method as well as parameters used
 - Identified trends in mean fit time based on several parameters and saw the trade-off between test accuracy and training time as well as CV error and time to find the optimal parameters
 - Worked closely with three partners in a Jupyter Notebook in Google Collaboratory
